## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You have to install WordCloud from [here](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud). The rest of the code should run with the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
The necessary datafiles can be downloaded from [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) and should be in folder 2019 respectively 2018.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand:

1) What are the languages with most change worked with this year and desired next year?

2) Are there differences in countries?

and with the survey data of 2018

3) Is the raise or fall of a language also seen in survey a year ago?

4) How good is the value `LanguageDesireNextYear` in comparison to the real value `LanguageWorkedWith` from next year?

This project is part of the Data Science nano degree in Udacity.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There a one notebook here to answer the above questions. The notebook is well documented and markdown cells are used to assist the thought process. Additional you find the resulting notebook as html.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings you can find in the also available pdf file [here](https://github.com/klogges5/StackOverflowLanguages/blob/master/Raise_and_fall_of_programming_languages.pdf).
